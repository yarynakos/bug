# Bug

Create a Bug class (a problem in a project or product), which will contain a description, severity, deadline, status, assignee, etc. Add a Backlog class that contains a list of bugs. Implement the possibility of outputting bugs of a certain developer that have the RESOLVED status and sorting the backlog by severity.
